    "summary": "Crash Landing on You tells the story of two star-crossed lovers, Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin), a South Korean Chaebol heiress, and Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin), a member of the North Korean elite and a Captain in the North Korean Special Police Force.\nOne day while Yoon Se-ri is paragliding in Seoul, South Korea, a sudden tornado knocks her out and blows her off course. She awakens to find her paraglider had crashed into a tree in a forest in the DMZ in North Korea (an area forbidden for South Koreans). She then meets Ri Jeong-hyeok and falls into his arms when descending from the tree. Ri Jeong-hyeok eventually gives Yoon Se-ri shelter and develops plans to secretly help her return to South Korea. Over time, they fall in love, despite the divide and dispute between their respective countries.\nYoon Se-ri's family suppresses the news of her disappearance out of fear that it will depress the stock price of the family-controlled chaebol. In particular, Se-ri's two brothers, Se-Jung and Se-Hyung who are rivals, both claiming to be the rightful heir to their father's company. Just before Se-ri's disappearance, their father had announced that he planned to anoint her as an heir because his sons are incompetent. Her brothers are supported by their equally ambitious wives, Do Hye-Ji (Hwang Woo-seul-hye), and Ko Sang-a (Yoon Ji-min).\nSe-ri's and Jeong-hyeok's story is intertwined with that of Seo Dan (Seo Ji-hye) and Gu Seung-jun (Kim Jung-hyun). Dan is the beautiful daughter of a wealthy North Korean department store owner. She has been studying cello in Russia for several years but returns so that she can marry Jeong-hyeok, to whom she is engaged through an arranged marriage (and whom she has only met a few times). As she returns to Pyongyang, she crosses paths, not for the first time, with Gu Seung-jun. Gu Seung-jun, who had previously been engaged to Se-ri, fled to North Korea (under the protection of corrupt North Korean officers) in order to escape from the pursuit of Se-ri’s brother Se-Hyung, under whose incompetent watch he had embezzled large amounts of money. Although their initial encounters are unpleasant, they eventually fall in love.\nThe story follows Jeong-hyeok and Se-ri as they try to get her home. They both also discovered how their fate was connected with each other before even they had met. They are impeded by Cho Cheol-gang (Oh Man-seok), an evil State Security officer, who a number of years ago had arranged for the murder of Jeong-hyeok's older brother, an officer who tried to expose him. The story eventually shifts to Seoul where both comedy and drama ensue for all four main characters, Se-ri’s family, and the arch-villain Cho Cheol-gang."
